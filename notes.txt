   > web application
     - functional requirements (what functions does this web application have?)
       + how user interact with the web application (use case analysis)

       + does it really function? (quality assurance -> testing)
     - non-functional requirements
       + does your web application support concurrently 1,000,000 users? 
       + do you environment that people can access it via the browsers on their phones? (architecture)
         - mobile phones usually have intermittent internet connectivity
       + how do you protect users' data? 
         - security (can the system control who can see the data?)
         - privacy (can I control who can see my data?)
